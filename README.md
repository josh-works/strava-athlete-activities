# README

A small supporting application split from:

https://github.com/josh-works/strava_run_polylines_osm (OG python app)
https://github.com/josh-works/mobility-maps (rails replacement of OG python app)

This app that you're reading right now might end up picking up bits and pieces of the python app, for testing and profit.

For example, I've run a few migrations and created some basic classes.
